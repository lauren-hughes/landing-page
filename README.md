# landing-page
This project was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). It involved recreating a simple landing page from an image using placeholder content. Owing to personal preference, some minor modifications to the original format were made (e.g. images were added, grammatical changes). The project utilises HTML and CSS, and ultimately serves as a brief demonstration of some HTML and CSS skills. A particular focus was placed on the use of flexbox.
